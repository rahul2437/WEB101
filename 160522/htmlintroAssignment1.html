  <h1>b tag</h1>
  <p>The &lt;b&gt; HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use &lt;b&gt; for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the &lt;strong&gt; element to indicate that text is of special importance.</p>
  <h1>i tag</h1>
  <p>The &lt;i&gt; HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the &lt;i&gt; naming of this element.</p>
  <h1>u tag</h1>
  <p>The &lt;u&gt; HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.</p>
  <h1>select tag</h1>
  <p>The &lt;select&gt; HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.</p>
  <h1>button tag</h1>
  <p>The &lt;button&gt; HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.

    By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.</p>
